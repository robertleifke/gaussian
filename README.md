# Gaussian

⚠️ **WARNING**: This library is still under active development and not all functions have been thoroughly tested. It contains complex mathematical implementations that may contain errors. DO NOT use in production without comprehensive testing. Use at your own risk.

A solidity library inspired by [solstat](https://github.com/primitivefinance/solstat) for implementing Gaussian distribution functions. It expands on [solidity-cdf](https://github.com/fiveoutofnine/solidity-cdf) to implement a few more statistical functions such as Percent Point Function (PPF) to approximate an inverse CDF. The Guassian library is ideal for custom automated market makers and will be used in [Numo](https://github.com/numotrade). 

## Usage

```bash
forge install robertleifke/gaussian
```
